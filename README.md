Program reviewed by the University of California, Riverside.
------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Overview of Command Shells: [HERE](http://linuxgazette.net/111/ramankutty.html)

This program is developed to write a simple command shell called "RShell."

- It will offer similarities such as a ls command

- Execute the command of ls

- Take in & function calls

- Have special built in command "exit"


Bugs:
	1. Input: "bin/ls -Ra" will cause a streamline of random numbers. It is similar to the representive on bash but off.
	2. Formatting on bin/ls -l isn't formatted to the right correcty. Off by a few spaces.
	3. Bug when trying to -R on a folder with more than 3 directories (in the works!)
	4. Recursion still needs some fixing, found bugs with deep level ls -R commands
	5. 
   6.
